The documentation of the iexec tools and the blockchain is very detailed and it was very easy to get started with the project.

And the ai bot in the Iexec Explorer /discord server is really effective in pointing to the correct documentation sections and lot of issues which modern ai like chatgpt cant even index the docs and solved the issues. The discord team yderf , martin had solved my so many doubts of this hackathon

Thank U Whole Iexec Team 

When i had tested my iapp using mock protected data it had produced the result and i had  proceed to deploymentof my iapp and it had deployed but after testing my iapp in blockchain it fails and got an timeout error and after debugging it , I always get an error "DETERMINISM_HASH_NOT_FOUND" . 

It may due to so many issues like Timeout ,Missing /iexec_out output,Enclave runtime failure,Infinite loop or heavy computation, It leads to unnecessary debugging and confusion.

After reading multiple blogs , i had fixed the issue later .

Please provide clearer and more specific error messages, along with documentation that explains the exact cause of failures and how to fix them, instead of showing generic errors.

Another issue is the difference between local testing and onchain execution. Mock protected data is useful for logic validation, but actual protected data execution needs to comply with the strict TEE determinism and runtime requirements, which can lead to unexpected failures onchain with limited error visibility. Better error messages and a simpler CLI tool for creating and managing Protected Data would be a great improvement for development testing.
