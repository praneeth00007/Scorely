The documentation of the iexec tools and the blockchain is very detailed and it was very easy to get started with the project.

And the ai bot in the Iexec Explorer /discord server is really effective in pointing to the correct documentation sections and lot of issues which modern ai like chatgpt cant even index the docs and solved the issues. The discord team yderf , martin had solved my so many doubts of this hackathon

Thank U Whole Iexec Team 

Creating and deploying Protected Data via CLI currently requires multiple steps (encrypt, init, deploy, push-secret), which can be difficult for beginners. A single high-level CLI command (similar to iapp deploy) that handles encryption, deployment, and secret management automatically would greatly simplify on-chain testing and improve the developer experience, since many developers end up building a frontend just to create Protected Data and test their iApp after deployment.
